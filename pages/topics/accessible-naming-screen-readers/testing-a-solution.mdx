# Testing a Given ARIA Solution

Test it yourself.

Compare your analytics to the WebAIM screen reader surveys to know what to prioritize.

You can also look to:

- People who use screen readers regularly
- A11ySupport.io
- ARIA Authoring Practices
- GitHub issue trackers (NVDA, WAI-ARIA, WCAG, etc.)
- WebAIM email discussion list

## Remember that screen readers aren’t the only thing in accessibility

”Why would a feature need to be visible if it’s for screen reader users?” (like skip links)
