# The Visual vs. Non-Visual Experience

We have to consider the experience of our pages beyond the visual, with semantic structure and content. But we can’t forget about the visual experience, either!

We touched on accessible naming with `aria-label` in [accessible name computation](/topics/accessible-naming-screen-readers/ARIA-accessible-name-computation). Here are a few scenarios for you to consider:

- Icon buttons
- aria-labels
- Exposing accessibility information for a given design

## A cautionary note

Many times, developers fire up a screen reader and want to make things _perfect_. It’s the screen reader equivalent of chasing pixel perfection. But it’s even harder to do with screen readers because accessibility APIs on various platforms have unavoidable differences.

Rather than sinking a bunch of time into trying to craft the perfect screen reader announcement (such as for phone numbers, dates, etc.), get something working that’s _good enough_. Test it with users who rely on AT if possible. 

Bottom line: don’t try too hard to make labeling perfect for Assistive Technology...you could make the experience worse.
