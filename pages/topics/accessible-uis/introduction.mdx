# The Foundations of Accessibility Apply

Design with access in mind: colors, icons, intuitive interfaces (test assumptions with users)

Valid semantic markup with HTML & ARIA
- There may be framework-specific quirks, but the _rendered_ output needs to be accessible no matter what
- Understand what ARIA is doing for you before using it (e.g. `disabled` vs. `aria-disabled`)

Structure with headings and landmarks

Interactivity with keyboards and screen readers
