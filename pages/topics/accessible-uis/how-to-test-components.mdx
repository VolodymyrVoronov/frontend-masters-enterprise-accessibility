# How to Test a UI Component for Accessibility

You should get in the habit of testing UI components for accessibility every time you work on them, and as often as possible when reviewing your colleaguesâ€™ work.

Here are the steps I take regularly to test components and pages:

1. Use the keyboard to TAB through the page. Can you reach, operate, and see every interactive control on the screen? Can you use the arrow keys for compound widgets?
    - Note that not everything has to be interactive for screen readers (e.g. headings)!
2. Run a browser extension like Axe or Accessibility Insights to surface WCAG violations and best practices.
    - Debug elements using the browser DevTools as well.
3. Zoom in to at least 200% to make sure pages reflow without horizontal scrolling. Do any components break when zoomed in?
4. Test with a screen reader like VoiceOver or NVDA.
5. Check that animation, motion, and autoplaying video can be turned off with controls and Reduced Motion settings.
6. Make note of any media in need of captions, transcripts, and other alternative content.
