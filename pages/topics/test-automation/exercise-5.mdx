# Testing Exercise

Let’s write some tests for our Portal Switcher component with Jest and Testing Library. We’ll also identify some potential test cases for other tools, including Cypress.

Here is the component once again. You can find this exercise in the `completed-components/exercise-5-tests` directory.

<div className="w-full bg-[#e7e5e5] min-h-[220px] mt-6">
    <div className="box-border bg-white h-[5.25rem] pt-[1rem] pb-[2.75rem]">
        <PortalSwitcher />
    </div>
</div>

## Remotely-hosted version

You can play around with this exercise again locally or on StackBlitz:

<StackBlitz name="stackblitz-starters-31bhpt" view="both" />
