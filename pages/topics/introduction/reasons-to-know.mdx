# Reasons to know this material

Something brought you to this accessibility workshop. Personal interest or curiosity, career growth potential, or a professional requirement? (Whatever your reason, I’m glad you’re here.)

Accessibility is the right thing to do. It’s about upholding civil rights for people with disabilities. It’s also a component of creating quality software. Those are good reasons to care.

When it comes to the [business side of accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/), sometimes companies need some convincing. There are misconceptions that accessibility is too costly and too niche to be worthwhile.

While accessibility does require some additional time (I’ve seen estimates of about 30% when planned for up front), the cost of _not_ including accessibility is way higher. Having to redo everything to meet accessibility requirements is incredibly costly and wasteful. When you put it that way, companies can’t afford _not_ to include accessibility.

## Motivation for organizations

Organizations have varied reasons for caring about accessibility. It could even be a combination of factors.

Sometimes executive leadership has personal experience with disability (like [Satya Nadella](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fathering-son-disability-helped-ceo-satya-nadella-transform-microsoft-through-empathy), CEO of Microsoft) that trickles down into team priorities.

Other times, organizations have legal risk and compliance obligations that bring accessibility to the forefront. Certain areas of business do have requirements for accessibility. This includes anything procured by a Federal Government with accessibility laws on the books (like the US, Canada, UK and EU) and education, to start.

## Market pressure for accessibility

There can also be market pressure to be accessible, perhaps from losing business to a more accessible competitor or from watching a competitor’s experience with lawsuits and the judicial system. It’s true that many lawsuits for accessibility unfortunately seem not to have the best intentions. But it’s also true that barriers to access are valid and that litigation/negotoations have led to improved websites and digital applications.

There is a lot to learn about the legal side of accessibility. I recommend following Lainey Feingold ([lflegal.com](https://lflegal.com)) and reading up on legal requirements for accessibility in your area.

## At the heart of this workshop

Accessibility is the right thing to do. It’s also a component of creating quality software.

My goal for you in this workshop is to instill these ideas and skills:

- Tech leads should be able to teach team members how to create quality software.
- To understand core design/engineering requirements for accessibility.
