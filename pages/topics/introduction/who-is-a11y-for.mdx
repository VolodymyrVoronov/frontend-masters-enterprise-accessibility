# Who is Accessibility for?

Remember what accessibility is really about: preventing and removing barriers to access for people with disabilities. Accessibility efforts can help other people in the future too. But the people who need access now but are blocked from doing so are reason enough to prioritize it.

We will dive deeper into the purpose, outcomes, and meaning of centering disability and working towards more inclusive workplaces in the section on [Organizational Skill Building](/topics/org-skill-building/inclusive-workplaces) later in this workshop.

For now, understand that the whole reason for making something accessible is so that people with disabilities can use it. Keep this in mind when you learn techniques and as you apply them, even while you’re juggling multiple priorities.

## An example of increasing awareness

<figure className="my-6 float-right max-w-[320px] ml-6">
    <img src="/smart-headings-meme.jpg" alt="Smart thinking meme: Your headings won’t be the wrong level if you don’t use headings" />
    <figcaption className="text-right font-bold mt-2"><em>Use headings, though.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

I recently gave a presentation at work on accessibility engineering. One of my coworkers asked about whether he really needed to include `h1-h6` headings if they risked being the wrong heading level. I gently pointed out his bias in this perspective, and described how important headings can be to someone using a screen reader. (Headings create a semantic structure that help someone understand and navigate a document).

By highlighting the real reason we use HTML headings, my colleagues understood their purpose much better and they could move forward with practical guidance. This is a positive example of the kind of conversation we can have when we discuss the purpose of accessibility and what’s at stake if we leave it out.
