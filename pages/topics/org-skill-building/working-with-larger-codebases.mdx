# Working with Larger Codebases

## Utilize core components with accessibility baked in

## Observe conventions and don’t be afraid to suggest more accessible improvements

## Make accessibility easy to test

- Include preview URLs and Storybook stories (or similar)
- Bake accessibility into tests

## Look for accessibility documentation including testing steps, or create some

## Use consistent accessibility test rules and processes

## Talk to your teammates / code authors to understand their approach

- hopefully you won’t run into some bad attitudes or egos...that can be a real challenge
