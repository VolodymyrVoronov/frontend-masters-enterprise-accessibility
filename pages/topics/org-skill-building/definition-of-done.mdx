# Including Accessibility in Your Definition of Done

How to ensure accessibility isn’t skipped or missed: make it a requirement that’s documented in tickets, stories, issues, etc. This means that team members in varied roles need to be on board: PMs, design, development, QA and more.

Including accessibility as acceptance criteria can help to surface it at a good time: before something has shipped. It’s way more costly to fix something after the fact. So if we can address it during requirements gathering and build accessibility into our implementations from the beginning (with reminders in our tickets), we will be more consistent at it.

## Make it an actual requirement

It’s one thing to list “WCAG 2.2 AA” in lists and docs that teams may or may not see. It’s another to uphold accessibility as a requirement in design, development, code reviews, and QA. There’s some accountability that needs to happen as well. Accessibility isn’t going to get done on its own most of the time.

## Create a repeatable manual and automated testing process

Teams have to know first that accessibility is a requirement and then know how to test it! Checklists are only a starting point. But having a repeatable, shareable process for accessibility testing will be a lot more impactful than none.

This advice is mostly geared at teams and companies without accessibility teams in house. But even if you do have that expertise at your company, do what you can to connect everything together and help their work be more successful. You could help drive adoption of pre-existing training, requirements, and other resources within your own team.

## Include accessibility in performance reviews (and interviews)

We discussed inclusive hiring and centering disability quite a bit. But I want to make one last plug for accessibility in the workplace: include it as data in performance reviews. How did people perform when it came to producing accessible work? Can you safely provide constructive feedback on your peers or upward reviews on areas for improvement?

On the flip side, if you’re involved with interviewing with or for a company: ask about accessibility in the day to day. How is it represented (or not) in their process? Would accessibility factor into performance and metrics on a broad scale, tying back to the definition of done on a smaller scale?
