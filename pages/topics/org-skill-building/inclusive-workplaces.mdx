# Inclusive Hiring & Workplaces

As we aim to make improvements for acccessibility, we can’t lose track of our purpose: to prevent and remove barriers for and with people with disabilities on the web. This isn’t about charity, pity, or saviorism. It’s about creating quality software that people with disabilities can use now, along with people who develop disabilities in the future.

There is a sad irony that many of the workplaces where we strive to do this work are inherently inaccessible. Software and hiring processes at the very start of the interview process can keep people with disabilities out. And even if someone with a disability who needs accommodations does get hired, they will likely meet barriers and discrimination on the job.

## Ensure there aren’t discriminatory tools or practices keeping people with disabilities out

As allies for accessibility and disability rights, we should point this stuff out when we see it. Be diplomatic but up front about it, when you can–although, I understand this could be well outside of the scope of your role.

Are there more accessible alternatives to the software procured for interviews, HR, performance reviews, etc.? If you work on one of these products, can you make some noise internally about the cost of inaccessible software on people’s careers and livelihoods? This isn’t just a statistics thing. Employment discrimination is unfortunately common for people with disabilities, and it has a profound impact on people. Let’s contribute to making the work world more accessible and equitable.

## Identify accessibility in products to pave the way for more inclusive hiring and jobs

When I worked at a startup, I noticed some software applications we used for performance reviews and HR had some accessibility issues...they were easy to spot. I was in a position to provide feedback to two companies on accessibility of their software, so I did. One of the companies was so eager to improve that they scheduled a call with me to digest the feedback and learn more. The other ignored my feedback and accessibility issues persist to this day, although I hear they are trying to improve.

All this to say, if you find accessibility feedback on a website or web application that could be pivotal to someone’s employment experience, try to speak up (and prioritize your feedback to the biggest blockers / most impactful issues).

It takes time and effort to provide free feedback (and frankly, time is money). But occasionally you might open the door to something being improved. And that is a wonderful thing.
