# Centering People with Disabilities

As we beat the drum of accessibility, we can’t forget what it’s all about: making the web more usable by someone with a disability. We don’t want to get caught up in making the web more accessible _for_ people with disabilities: we need to make the web more accessible _with_ people with disabilities.

We discussed [inclusive hiring and workplaces](/topics/org-skill-building/inclusive-workplaces), which is a huge part of centering disability so you have team members in house to provide their perspectives and make contributions with their lived experience. That should be a goal of any company.

You may not be in a position to hire or affect hiring, though. Are there still ways that you can center people with disabilities in your projects? Yes, there are.

People with disabilities [should be involved](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-centering-accessibility-data-visualization) in design and development as often as possible. When people can provide accessibility feedback on product designs and concepts (the earlier the better!), this feedback will be pivotal toward making the design more successful in an accessible context.

## Advocating for people with disabilities in design and development

Find areas to consult with people with disabilities whenever you can: designs, prototypes, whole pages, anything! You aren’t sure how something would be received by someone with a disability? Ask for their input! You can work with groups like [Fable](https://makeitfable.com) to add to your organization’s knowledge and experience in a project context. 

Look for perspectives and personas of people with disabilities when you read through accessibility specs, guidelines, and other materials to understand how something might affect them. These artifacts aren’t as good as having feedback from a real person. But you should always seek to understand how your design or code implementation would impact someone with a disability. It will make your designs better.

## The social media effect

It was pointed out to me years ago that there’s a difference between _Accessibility Twitter_ and _Disability Twitter_. Twitter is sadly not what it once was. But there’s still an important takeaway here: the stories shared on _Disability Twitter_ are often different than the professional banter and technical knowledge sharing on _Accessibility Twitter_.

We would be wise to listen up when people with disabilities share their lived experience (and understandable frustrations), and don’t forget our true purpose of making the web barrier-free.
